🎮 CS 330 – Computational Graphics and Visualization

📖 Overview

This repository contains my final portfolio artifacts for CS 330: the 3D Scene project ZIP folder and the Design Decisions document. Together, these materials showcase my ability to design and implement a fully realized 3D world using C++, OpenGL, and modern graphics programming techniques. This work highlights not only my technical proficiency in computational graphics but also my ability to follow structured design and development processes.

🛠️ How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I focus on breaking down the problem into modular components and ensuring the design aligns with both functionality and user experience. For the 3D scene, I organized objects, textures, and lighting into logical structures that supported flexibility and clarity.

🎨 What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project strengthened my ability to balance visual creativity with technical constraints. I learned how to design object hierarchies, apply textures and lighting realistically, and think critically about how users visually interact with a scene.

🔄 What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed an iterative design process starting with a basic scene layout, gradually adding textures, and refining the lighting until the environment felt immersive. Each milestone guided incremental improvements toward the final product.

🚀 How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The same iterative, modular approach can be applied to any software project, allowing me to test functionality step by step while leaving room for creativity and innovation.

💻 How do I approach developing programs?

I approach programming with a modular and test-driven mindset, ensuring each component works before integrating it into the full system. For this project, I separated responsibilities between scene management, textures, and lighting to maintain clarity.

🧩 What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I adopted strategies such as incremental testing, debugging through visualization (using color and light feedback), and using reusable code structures for transformations and shaders.

🔁 How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was central. I built the scene in layers, refining objects, applying materials, and adjusting light placement after seeing the results in real time.

📈 How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?

I became more disciplined with commenting, formatting, and modularization. Each milestone reinforced the importance of clean, readable code that can be revisited and improved efficiently.

🎯 How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills and technical depth to pursue a professional career in cybersecurity and software development, as well as long-term goals in technology-driven entrepreneurship.

🖼️ How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills?

This course taught me how to combine mathematics, physics, and programming to create engaging digital environments. These skills strengthen my technical foundation for both academic growth and professional projects.

🌐 How can these skills be applied in my future professional pathway?

Understanding computational graphics provides me with a deeper appreciation of system performance, user experience, and visual design, which I can apply not only in graphics-related work but also in designing secure, user-friendly software solutions in my cybersecurity career path.
